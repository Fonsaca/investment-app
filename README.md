# Investment App
A web app that enables the investor to have better insights of their investments.


### Scope
This portfolio project is focused on building the following functionalities:
* Manage investment goals;
* Asset purchase and sale information.

### Inspiration
After testing the options available in the market for managing the investments, Me and my friend Rafael realized they weren't good enough, those apps generally have some frustrating issues: investment information gone missing, uggly interfaces and simplistic insights. In addition to that, we want new funcionalities that we didn't find elsewhere.

With that motivation, we decide to create our own app.  
With Rafael's blessing I'm able to start it in this public repository.
