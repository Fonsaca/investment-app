# Investment App
A web app that enables the investor to have better insights of their investments.

### Inspiration
After testing the options available in the market for managing the investments, Me and my friend Rafael realized they weren't good enough, those apps generally have some frustrating issues: investment information gone missing, uggly interfaces and simplistic insights. In addition to that, we want new funcionalities that we didn't find elsewhere.

With that motivation, we decide to create our own app.  
With Rafael's blessing I'm able to start it in this public repository.

### Scope
This portfolio project is focused on building the following functionalities:
* Manage investment goals;
* Asset purchase and sell information.

### Description
People save money to fullfil their goals, for example, save for retirement, buy a house, mariage, hard times or financial independecy. So we think that everyone should have at least one financial plan to achieve his goal. 

But how will the investor make his investment? How conservative is He ? Well, many compositions of investments can be tailored by each investor to himself. So for each asset category there is the optimum percentage to invest, in fact, for each asset type there's the desired amount to invest. This is the first functionality.

With a plan defined, the investor shall input their asset transactions to fill the database and get insights of their investment. That is the second functionality.
